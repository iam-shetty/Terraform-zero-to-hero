## Day 1: Getting Started with Terraform

#### Introduction to Terraform and IaC

In this session, we'll introduce you to the fundamental concepts of Terraform and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Learn why Terraform is crucial for managing infrastructure and how IaC streamlines provisioning.

#### Installing Terraform on MacOS, Linux and Windows

Get your hands dirty by installing Terraform on both MacOS, Linux and Windows. We'll guide you through the process with clear instructions and commands.

#### Setting up Terraform for AWS

Dive into AWS integration with Terraform. You'll learn how to set up your AWS credentials and configure the AWS provider within Terraform to start provisioning resources.

#### Writing Your First Terraform Code

Start writing actual Terraform code with a simple example. Learn about the basic structure of a Terraform configuration file and how to define resources using the HCL language.

### Terraform Lifecycle

Understand the lifecycle of terraform. What is terraform `init`, `plan` and `apply`.

#### Launching an EC2 Instance

Take your skills up a notch by provisioning an EC2 instance on AWS using Terraform. Explore attributes like instance type, AMI, and tags to customize your instance.

#### Terraform State Basics

Understand the importance of Terraform state files. Learn about desired and current states, and how Terraform manages these states to ensure infrastructure consistency.

## Day 2: Advanced Terraform Configuration- AWS Providers

## Day 3: Building Reusable Infrastructure with Modules

#### Creating Modular Infrastructure with Terraform Modules

Unlock the potential of reusability with Terraform modules. Understand how modules enable you to create shareable and organized infrastructure components.

#### Local Values and Data Sources

Simplify complex expressions using local values. Dive into data sources and learn how to fetch data from existing resources or external systems, enhancing your configurations' flexibility.

#### Using Variables and Inputs with Modules

Explore the versatility of using variables within modules to customize their behavior. Learn how inputs work within modules and the benefits they offer.

#### Leveraging Outputs from Modules

Utilize module outputs to access critical information or propagate data to your root configuration. Learn how to make your modules more informative and useful.

#### Exploring Terraform Registry for Modules

Embark on a journey through the Terraform Registry. Discover pre-built, community-contributed modules and learn how to incorporate them into your own configurations.
