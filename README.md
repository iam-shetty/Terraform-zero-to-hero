# Terraform First Project: Remote Backend & Modules

This repository contains a sample Terraform project that demonstrates how to get started with Terraform—including setting up a remote backend, using modules for reusability, and discussing common Terraform interview Q&A topics. The project is inspired by the [Day-17 | Everything about Terraform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdfdKWRDB8&list=PLdpzxOOAlwvIKMhk8WhzN1pYoJ1YU8Csa&index=21) tutorial video.

## Overview

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define, deploy, and manage infrastructure in a safe, repeatable, and efficient manner. In this project, you will learn to:

- Write your first Terraform configuration.
- Configure a remote backend for secure state management.
- Create and utilize Terraform modules for scalable code.
- Review key Terraform concepts and interview questions.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed (version X.Y.Z or later).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
- Access to your chosen cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) if you plan to deploy real infrastructure.
- [Optional] Cloud CLI tools (e.g., [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)) if you’re configuring a remote backend with a specific provider.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-first-project.git
   cd terraform-first-project
